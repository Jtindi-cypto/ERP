# ERP
A Microservice based ERP system

### ERP System Project Description

**Project Overview:**

This project involves the development of a microservice-based ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system designed to streamline and automate various business processes. The system uses modern technologies, including React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, MySQL as the database, and Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. This ERP system is scalable, modular, and designed to handle multiple business functions such as HR, Finance, Inventory, and Sales.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes

**Project Structure:**

1. **Frontend (React):**
   - A responsive user interface created using React.
   - Key components include a header, navigation, and various module interfaces.
   - React Router is used to navigate between different parts of the application.

2. **Backend (Node.js):**
   - A robust backend server built with Node.js and Express.js.
   - RESTful APIs are created to handle various business logic and data manipulation.
   - MySQL is used for persistent storage of business data.

3. **Database (MySQL):**
   - A relational database to store and manage business data.
   - Includes tables for users, employees, products, orders, and other business entities.

4. **Containerization (Docker):**
   - Both frontend and backend applications are containerized using Docker.
   - Docker Compose is used to manage multi-container applications, including the MySQL database.

5. **Orchestration (Kubernetes):**
   - Kubernetes is used for deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
   - Deployment and service files are created for frontend, backend, and MySQL database.

**Deployment Process:**

1. **Version Control:**
   - All project code is managed using Git and hosted on GitHub for collaboration and version control.

2. **Dockerization:**
   - Dockerfiles are created for both frontend and backend applications.
   - Docker Compose is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment:**
   - Kubernetes deployment files are created for managing the lifecycle of the applications.
   - Services are created to expose the applications and manage network communication.

4. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - The project can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment.

**Key Features:**

- **Modular Design:** The ERP system is designed with a modular approach, allowing easy addition of new features and modules.
- **Scalability:** The use of microservices and Kubernetes ensures the system can scale efficiently to handle increased loads.
- **Responsive UI:** The frontend is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience across devices.
- **Robust Backend:** The backend is built to handle complex business logic and data processing securely and efficiently.
- **Persistent Storage:** MySQL provides reliable and consistent data storage, with well-defined relationships between business entities.

**Future Enhancements:**

- **Additional Modules:** Expanding the system to include more business functions such as CRM, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain Management.
- **User Authentication:** Implementing secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Adding advanced reporting and analytics features to provide business insights.
- **Integration with Third-Party Services:** Integrating with external services like payment gateways, shipping services, and other APIs.

This ERP system project provides a solid foundation for automating and managing various business processes, offering flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
